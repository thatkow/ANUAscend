# Ascend

## Notes

* When you switch a wall to Coloring by Grade, any climb without a recorded grade is shown in a neutral grey so it stands out from graded problems.
* Setters can configure the Bezier line thickness for each wall from **Configuration → Appearance** to keep freeform strokes consistent across views.
* Filled point transparency can also be tuned per wall in **Configuration → Appearance** so solid markers stay legible across view modes.
